python-BindingEnergyofaNucleon
==============================

Python program to calculate the binding energy of a Nucleon. This is for Exercise 2.9 (Python Programming for Physicists) of Computational Physics.

Exercise 2.9: The semi-empirical mass formula
=============================================

In nuclear physics, the semi-empirical mass formula for calculating the approximate nuclear binding energy (BE_N) of of an atomic nucleus with atomic number Z and mass number A.

Where in units of millions of electron volts, the constants are a1 (15.67), a2 (17.23), a3 (0.75), and a4 (93.2).

a5 changes depending on A:
* 0 if A is odd
* 12.0 if A and Z are both even
* -12.0 if A is even and Z is odd
